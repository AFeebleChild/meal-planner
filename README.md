# meal-planner

A simple app to generate meal ideas for when you need help during the week.

`./meal-planner random` will pick a random recipe from recipes.yaml to print out.

The `-i` flag can be used to search for recipes matching an ingredient, or multiple ingredients, to pick from.
Only recipes matching all comma separated ingredients will be picked from.

`./meal-planner random -i chicken,parsley`
